For this project, Scirra’s Construct 2 was used. This environment provides tools for creating small games and game prototypes using a visual interface. No programming is required since conditions and commands are already built into the application. This is the same kind of programming that Microsoft’s Kodu uses for development.

The development can be downloaded on Scirra’s website (https://www.scirra.com/).

The executable for the game is included on the “Nuklear (compiled game)” folder. No extra application should be necessary. The game was exported by default to HTML5 and a web browser like Chrome or Firefox is the only requirement.

Because the game uses some javascript and jquery files, Chrome might block the game from running. An extra batch file was included inside which automatically opens chrome on a “no restriction” mode and allows to play the game without effort.

If this doesn’t work, press Win+R (Run) and type “start chrome --allow-file-access-from-files” without the quotes. This should open a “no restriction” chrome window. Drag the index.html file onto this window and play.

For Firefox, no special command is required just open the browser and dragging the index.html or simply double clicking the file if Firefox is the default browser.

Bugs that have been found are sounds not loading when opening the game with Firefox. Scirra specifies that the game should be uploaded to a server to be run correctly on all browsers. This can’t be done because we have no servers to upload the game to.

Sound effects were created AS3SFXR online tool and exported to wav and ogg files. (http://www.superflashbros.net/as3sfxr/). Music was provided by Incompetech’s Royalty Free music. (http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html)

All graphics used in the game are creation of the members of this project.

Roles of the team members:
Alan Andrés Mar: Main programming and concept for the game.
Daniel Orozco: Art for the game and concept for the characters and GUI.
Franck Ngatcha: Extra programming tasks and level creation.
